# 📊 Power BI Dashboard - Superstore Sales Analysis

This project contains a Power BI dashboard built using the **Sample - Superstore** dataset. The purpose is to analyze sales, profit, discount, and regional performance across various categories, sub-categories, and geographies.

## 📁 Dataset
- **Name:** Sample - Superstore
- **Format:** CSV
- **Source:** Public dataset commonly used for data visualization practice
- **Contents:** Orders with details like order date, sales, profit, discount, region, state, sub-category, and more.

## 🔧 Tools Used
- Power BI Desktop
- Excel/CSV for data source
- Data visualization and basic transformations

## 📈 Visualizations Included

1. **Sales & Profit by Region** (Bar Chart)  
   Compare how different regions perform in terms of revenue and profit.

2. **Sales by Sub-Category** (Bar Chart)  
   Shows which product sub-categories generate the most revenue.

3. **Profit by State** *(Alternative: Bar Chart instead of Map)*  
   Visualizes which U.S. states are profitable or incurring losses.

4. **Sales Over Time** (Line Chart)  
   Displays trends in sales over months.

5. **Discount vs Profit** (Scatter Plot)  
   Shows how discounts impact profitability.

## 🔍 Insights Summary

- The **West** and **East** regions contribute the most to total sales.
- **Technology** and **Office Supplies** are top-performing categories.
- Certain **sub-categories like Copiers** have high profits, while others like **Tables** often lead to losses.
- Some states are running at a loss (e.g., **Texas**, **Illinois**) while others are highly profitable (e.g., **California**).
- As **discounts increase**, profit tends to **drop significantly**, suggesting over-discounting hurts margins.

## 🚫 Map Visual Limitation
Due to tenant admin settings, **map and filled map visuals are disabled**. A bar chart was used as an alternative to show profit by state.

## 📥 How to Use

1. Open `Sample - Superstore.csv` in Power BI.
2. Load and transform the data if needed.
3. Use the report canvas to view and interact with visuals.
